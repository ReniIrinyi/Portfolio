    "text": "I created this beautiful Landing Page for a local organisation. The project is close to my heart, it is the first project where I have had complete freedom. I tried to create a clear design, but it was important to be playful at the same time.",
    "tech": "Angular, Html5, CS3, Sass, Node.js, Express, MySQL",
    "description": "The aim of the application, in addition to providing information, was to fully automate the registration and processing of forms. On the homepage you can simply check the latest information about KiWo. You can use the website to register for the following event.",
    "description2": "The website is very simple, I wanted it to be completely transparent and accessible from any device. I also wanted a database to make it easier to process the data.",
    "description3": "So I created a MySQl database and the registration form is processed using a Node.js/Express application.From the data received/likely stored in the database, the application generates an Excel file and sends it as an attachment to the desired email address.",
    "conclusion": "The website is one of my first projects, from the end of 2022. In the first version I was only able to write front-end code, using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In the new, updated version of August 2023, I completely rebuilt the application using Angular and developed server-side processing of formular data. The most challenging part of the project was processing the online signature and how to embed the signature in the correct format into an Excel file generated by my application. I still see a lot of room for improvement in hindsight, so I imagine there will be a few more updates in the future. "

    "text": "Since every decent developer has a portfolio, it seemed like a great idea to apply my newly acquired Angular skills to such a project. I really enjoyed the development and tried a bunch of new things and experimented a lot.",
    "conclusion": "The main purpose of the website is to provide a platform where I can showcase a selection of my projects. I aimed to make it dynamic, allowing for easy updates in the future. Additionally, I wanted to include a component that displays a list of all projects, and when you click on a project, it opens the corresponding project details component. Simplicity, transparency, and a design that reflects my personality were also key considerations. The site predominantly features my favorite colors, creating a cohesive and personalized aesthetic.",
    "tech": "Angular, Typescript, JavaScript, Html5, CS3, Sass",
    "description1": "Before I jumped into the implementation, I tried to put together the necessary information first. Because of the simplicity of the website, a database would have been overkill, so I saved the data for each project in a Json file. Using the Service I created, I dynamically generate projects via project-model and *ngFor directive, which I list and display as I like.",
    "description2": "The first time I came across Vincent Garreau's particles library, I think it was around 2022, and I was immediately impressed. I knew that if I ever had my own portfolio, I would definitely implement it. There are a lot of videos and blogs on the internet about how to add it to a project, but I realized that it's much simpler than that. You can find the exact description in my blog. ",
    "description3": "It was important to me that the website could be viewed from all devices, and I followed the principles of mobile-first design, so I developed the site for the smallest screen size and then worked my way up."

    "description1": "At the beginning of my studies, when I got acquainted with HTML and CSS, I started to tackle these fantastic challenges with the aim of improving my skills. However, I reserved the last two challenges in the 'Responsive Web Development' category for the time when I would be able to solve them with the help of a framework. Now, that time has come. I am thrilled to say that I successfully completed the development of the website using Angular. I am very proud of the final result."

    "text": "I created this Christmas-themed website for the local Advent window group, which has a history of more than 25 years. Despite the simplicity of the website, I learned something new again: I managed to implement the Google Maps API, as requested, so that users can find the windows accurately. I also created an interactive Advent window with Sass, which was a lot of fun. ",
