    "conclusion": "The website is one of my first projects, from the end of 2022. I'm very proud of it, although I can see the flaws and where it could be improved. In the future, I would like to develop a back-end and upload the images from the gallery to the site via a database and not hard-coded.",

    "text": "Since every decent developer has a portfolio, it seemed like a great idea to apply my newly acquired Angular skills to such a project. I really enjoyed the development and tried a bunch of new things and experimented a lot.",
    "conclusion": "The main purpose of the website is to provide a platform where I can showcase a selection of my projects. I aimed to make it dynamic, allowing for easy updates in the future. Additionally, I wanted to include a component that displays a list of all projects, and when you click on a project, it opens the corresponding project details component. Simplicity, transparency, and a design that reflects my personality were also key considerations. The site predominantly features my favorite colors, creating a cohesive and personalized aesthetic.",
    "tech": "Angular, Typescript, JavaScript, Html5, CS3, Sass",
    "description1": "Since the main focus of the course was on Java, I didn't learn much about backend service communication in angular, so obviously before I jumped into the implementation, I tried to put together the necessary information first. Because of the simplicity of the website, a database would have been overkill, so I saved the data for each project in a Json file. Using the Service I created, I dynamically generate projects via project-model and *ngFor directive, which I list and display as I like.  ",
    "description2": "The first time I came across Vincent Garreau's particles library, I think it was around 2022, and I was immediately impressed. I knew that if I ever had my own portfolio, I would definitely implement it. There are a lot of videos and blogs on the internet about how to add it to a project, but I realized that it's much simpler than that. You can find the exact description in my blog. ",
    "description3": "It was important to me that the website could be viewed from all devices, and I followed the principles of mobile-first design, so I developed the site for the smallest screen size and then worked my way up."
